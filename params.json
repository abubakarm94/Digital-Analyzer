The bulk of the work is done through a neural network that allows the computer to learn various samples from persistent training. In doing this, we are trying to figure out the best way to implement a neural network that would work analogous with programs dealing with image thresholding and connected components. Due to the time constraint ahead of us, we are also trying to figure out the fastest way to implement this. We chose this project because originally we wanted to do something with deep learning. We were very fascinated with the way that various companies such as Facebook have been able to do things concerning this topic and thus decided to do something similar to this.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nFor most humans recognizing handwritten characters and digits seems like a fairly easy task to do. However, this simple task becomes very difficult when trying to request a computer to recognize handwritten characters and digits. What once seemed as an easy task becomes extremely difficult. As we have learned through online research and through speaking with Dr. Kim, we have learned that Neural Networks have tried to alleviate the difficulty of handwriting recognition. What Neural Networks do is uses large numbers of handwritten samples to infer rules for recognizing digits. While researching there have been many developments of digit recognition. Various methods of digit recognition have utilized a small sample of handwritten digits which have decreased the accuracy of the program. When using these sample programs there have been many times were the program has incorrectly guessed the digit that was written. For our project we will try to implement digit recognition first by using the MNIST database of handwritten digits which has a training set of 60,000 examples to try to ensure that out neural network is as accurate as possible. Given our time constraint for this semester if achieving digit recognition is feasible, we will then attempt to implement character recognition. Given that there is not a known and reliable database for English characters, our implementation may not be as accurate because we will not have a large sample size however, we will still use a smaller sample size and try to get a decent accuracy rate for both digit and English character recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Progress\r\n\r\nAug 31st – Sep 4th: During this week, we chose our team members, and started to discuss what topics we were interested in tackling for our project. Since there are four members in our group, we each came up with one topic, and one together to have 5 overall to choose from.  \r\n\r\nSep 7th – 11th: During this week, we started to discuss which project we would all agree upon doing. We all agreed on doing a hand writing recognizer neural network. However, after we decided on that, we changed our topic because we thought it would not be a sufficient amount of time to finish the project in one semester. The new project was going to be a tutoring connecting website.  We proposed this new idea to Prof. Kim, but he insisted that we stick with the Neural Network, and that it would be able to get done in the timeframe permitted. With that reassurance, we officially settled on our project being the “Digital Analyzer.”\r\n\r\nSep 14th  - 18th:  During this week, we did a large amount of on the topic we were tackling. We got a glimpse into how the actual network worked. Also, we met with Prof. Kim and he told us about a few classes that we would need in order to break down images, and use those bit to work with our neural network.  So, after that we started searching around for source code for our project, and also decided on using Java as our developing language. \r\n\r\nSep 21st  - 25th: During this week, we found sample source code for our Image Thresholding, Connected Component, and neural network. After that, we had to actually get the code compiled, documented, and running. So, for the majority of the week we worked on that.\r\n\r\nSep 28th  – Oct 2nd: During this week, we finally got all of our separate classes working, and doing what they were actually met to do. We ran into several problems when trying to compile the classes, but eventually got them working properly. We then started to feed these classes sample data to make sure that they would function properly on whatever data we decided to feed it. \r\n\r\nOct 5th – 9th:  This week will be used to present our progress so far to our professor, and fellow classmates, and to also discuss the next steps that are needed to progress our project.\r\n\r\nOct 12th - 16th: Our code for Image threshold was merged with the code for finding connected components in order to make it work hand in hand.\r\n\r\nOct 19th - 23rd: Sections of the image that are found through connected component analyses is that returnable as a unique image. We believe that this is crucial for when we to pass each section to the Neural Network.\r\n\r\nOct 26 – Oct 30: Get the connected component and image segmentation to work in unison. Did testing to make sure that the results were coming out as expected and that there were no compilation errors or unexpected results\r\n \r\nNov 4 – Nov 7: Worked on getting the MNIST database to train our computer for the Neural Network. The MNIST database is a database of handwritten digits and contains a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
